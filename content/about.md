The absolute highlights of every year for me are my trips to conferences around
the world and exploring the cities they take place in. For years I've used
services like FourSquare/Swarm, Yelp, Tripadvisor and Google+ to keep track of
all the places I've been to and then create a summary post on my blog.

I just felt a bit sad about having so much of my life on 3rd-party services and
not a single place to collect all my memories from these travels. That's the
main motivation behind this blog. Sure, I could have put everything up on
zerokspot.com and I have no problem doing a travel post every once in a while
there (esp. since that is still *my* personal blog), but while traveling I want
to post so much that it would completely flood that blog with more or less
off-topic content.

So what will you find here? Mostly personal stories from cities as I visit them
and most definitely hotel and restaurant reviews!
