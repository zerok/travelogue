Another year, another FOSDEM... at least the second for me ðŸ˜Š Last year was
extremely interesting and so I started planning for this trip already in
September 2015 and even convinced Ulrich to join me this time around!

If you don't know FOSDEM, it's probably the largest OpenSource and FreeSoftware
gathering in Europe that is organized every year at the end of January in
Brussels. The entry is even free ðŸ˜ƒ

You can find more details about FOSDEM on [fosdem.org](https://fosdem.org/).
