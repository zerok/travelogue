Django Under The Hood is an event with a bit more focus on Django's core than
DjangoCon Europe, for instance. It's also a bit more intimate but still has the
same awesome family-gathering flair that the slightly larger event does. This
time was my first year here and I planned to combine it with a trip to Paris
right afterwards for dotGo. So for the whole trip, you will have to check the
posts for both journeys ðŸ˜Š
