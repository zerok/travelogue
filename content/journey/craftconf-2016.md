Only a couple of weeks after DjangoCon Europe I returned to Budapest for my very
first CraftConf. Hosted in an old railway museum this event was simply
huge. Actually, perhaps a bit too big for me. That being said, I'm pretty sure
I'll try to come back next year esp. when not every second conference takes
place in the Hungarian capital ðŸ˜‰
