Originally the weather report for Sunday said rain for most of the
day. Luckily, that changed over night and so until 2 p.m. everything was fine
and I could explore the area north from the hotel along Chicago River a little
more.

On the first evening this area kind of put me off but now with sun and me
focusing on the river itself I absolutely see the appeal! There are enough
plazas and small parks along both banks to less the oppressive feeling these
huge skyscrapers have on my.

And [Marina City][mc] combined parking and office/residential buildings just
look funny. Especially after I noticed that below the parking lot there are
also docks for boats.

The closer I got to the lake the more pleasant the walkways along the river
became and eventually it was quiet enough to sit down and simply enjoy the
sun. There are also supposed be be a couple of fountains on the way (like the
[Nicholas J Melas Centennial Fountain][mf]), but the "No Swimming" signs are
probably a bit pre-mature.

Sadly, that walk ended once again in a huge construction site and I decided to
turn around and try my luck at the [Buckingham Fountain][bf]. No luck there
either, but I came across some other nice water-plays along the west side of
the Millenium Park we hadn't seen on our first walk through the park.
