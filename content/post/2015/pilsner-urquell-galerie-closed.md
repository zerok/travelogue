Yesterday was the last day of WriteTheDocs and between the end of the main
conference and a meetup organized and sponsored by
[Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) I had some time to kill. Ever since I first
saw them I wanted to have one of the famous
[Pilsner Urquell glasses](http://eshop.prazdroj.cz/en/pilsner-urquell/The-new-Pilsner-Urquell-05-l-glass-30017685). The
are simple yet surprisingly beautiful and I thought they might also work quite
well as a gift.

I was extremely happy when right before leaving the conference venue I found out
about a gift shop operated by the brewery itself in Prague through
[the praguebeergarden blog](http://www.praguebeergarden.com/news/post/pilsner-urquell-shop-souvenirs),
so I set out to find it. Turns out the
[Pilsner Urquell Galerie](http://galerie.pilsner-urquell.cz/en/) had been closed
last year but I found out too late to look for alternatives ðŸ˜©

Sadly, ordering these glasses directly from Pilsner Urquell is out of the
question as shipping is horrendously expensive. I guess I'll have to wait for
another trip to the Czech Republic then ðŸ˜‰

At least I found a really [nice beer shop](http://www.czechbeershop.com/) in the
same area where the gift shop would have been. Too bad I wasn't really prepared
to transport any beer home so I didn't buy anything there either ðŸ˜‰ That at least
left enough space for sweets in my backpack...
