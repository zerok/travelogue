On Friday we left Montréal behind and flew to Chicago. No delays and everything
else went well on that trip. I even spotted some ice on Lake Michigan:

Getting from the airport to the Hotel took quite some time, though, especially
when using public transport. On the plus-side the blue line stopped just one
block from our hotel ... which is currently under renovation so we had some
trouble spotting the main entrance. That and at least my room was so freshly
renovated that there was still some paint in the air. Not a big issue, though.

We decided to end the day at the [Bottlefork][bf], an upscale bar/restaurant,
which we chose based on pictures of a quite nice looking burger ... which
luckily ended up as tasty as it was good-looking :-) Rather expensive but
tasty.


# Chicago Day 1

The next morning we set out to explore the lake-side area of the city with the
obvious tourist attractions like the [Cloud Gate][cg] ...

... and the rest of the Millenium Park, which is just beautiful :D It
definitely makes up for all that iron, concrete and glass in the Loop district.

After that we walked along the lake shore down to the
[Adler Planetarium][ap]. As expected the main programme is more targeted at
families and younger children but the exhibitions are interesting also for
single and older people esp. thanks to their presentation. There is one room,
for instance, that describes all the planets in our system including listings
of all missions that where made to them. After a couple of exhibitions we ended
up in the planetarium's restaurant which offers a beautiful view out over the
lack and back to the city.

By the time we got out again it was already 3pm and we were starting to get
hungry. So we headed North-West into Wicker Park for some shopping and an
awesome New Haven-style pizza at [Piece][p].

After all that goodness we
decided it was a good time to stop moving altogether and to retire for the day
;-)
