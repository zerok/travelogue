On our second day in Budapest we finally made it to a Vodafone store to get some
data-only SIM cards. While still in Graz I had looked up the various offers and
saw that Vodafone had some pre-paid plans that offered
[1GB for 4000 Ft. (MaxL)][1]. Not cheap but also not really expensive compared
to what you'd pay in the US or Canada and more than enough for our needs.

When we entered the store we were greeted by a receptionist who asked us what we
needed and told us to sit down and wait until a service person was
available... which took nearly half an hour. Turns out people really need a lot
of time to describe their problems with mobile phones and the process of
purchasing a SIM card is rather complicated here ;-)

Eventually, it was our turn and we learnt that the plan I had originally found
online also included text messages, so the service person suggested a
[much cheaper plan ][2](2.490 Ft.)  with the same data cap but limited to a week
and without text messages. Perfect!

We even managed to only miss the first 5 minutes of
[Mikael Brevik's talk about "Functional UIs and Unidirectional Dataflow"][3]!
Just in time to notice that our provide choice might have been a poor one as we
has no reception inside the auditorium ;-)
