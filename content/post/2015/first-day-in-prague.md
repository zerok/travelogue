So, now my first day in Prague is nearly over and the city hasn't changed much
from what I can remember from about 10 years ago. Still a great place to visit
with tons of sights and very friendly staff at the restaurants I've been to.

Getting here wasn't that pleasant, though, as I got a mild sun-stroke and
enjoying the evening reception of
[WriteTheDocs](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/) ended after about 10
minutes when I had to go back to my hotel and lie down. Speaking of the
[hotel](http://www.hotelbb.cz/en/portal/): I'll probably write about it later
but so much for now: B&B Hotels continue to be a good choice for me.

After more than 10 hours of sleep, though, the world looked much better and just
looking at the conference venue from the outside made the rest of the headache
go away!

I'll write in detail about WriteTheDocs in a seperate post probably on
[zerokspot.com](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/).

After the conference I went restaurant-scouting and ended up at the
[T-Anker](http://t-anker.cz/cs/novinky/), a roof-top restaurant in the heart of
the city with a bit of an upper-class vibe. The waiter was extremely nice,
though, and didn't object to me only ordering beer as there was still the
WriteTheDocs party scheduled for later that day ðŸ˜Š

And ... well, [The Pub](http://www.thepub.cz/praha-1/?lng=en) is exactly the way
I remember it from when we went there during
[EuroDjangoCon 2009](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/05/09/eurodjangocon2009/)
(before the name change). Having a tap right at your table is awesome and being
able to order other things via touch-screen is ... so much easier than trying to
say it out loud with that ambient noice ðŸ˜‰ ... I got distracted. Anyway, the
noise level is sadly a bit too high to have a good conversation, but they also
have some outdoor seating where this is much easier. And interesting discussions
I definitely had!

So, that was my first day in Prague ðŸ˜Š Can't wait to get some sleep now and for
the 2nd day of WriteTheDocs to begin!
