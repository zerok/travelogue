alt=""> Well, given that this whole series is titled "PyCon 2015" I might as
well finally write about [the actual conference][3]... which ended two days
ago. The three conference days were full of great and esp. inspirational
keynotes and some excellent talks.

I feel like the topics this year were more diverse and less focused on education
compared to PyCon 2014. Probably the highlight besides the keynotes was
[Python Concurrency From the Ground Up: LIVE!][2] by David Beazley which was
basically a massive live-coding session. In general, there were tons of
concurrency-related talks, which is a good thing considering the success of
other languages like Go in this area.

Another awesome talk was [What can programmers learn from pilots?][5] by Andrew
Godwin:

At least to me it also looked like there was less language bashing going on,
something that has always annoyed me quite a lot at other events. There were
even some talks that recommended Go- or Java-based tools ;-)

Obviously, with 5 tracks there are still tons of talks that I haven't seen
yet. The video team did an amazing job here! All talks already seem to be
[on YouTube][4]. So perhaps I will still be blown away by multiple talks ;-)

As last year the conference was hosted in the
[Palais des congrès de Montréal][1] which is an amazing place in and of
itself. The windows on one side of the building are multi-colored which tinted
the whole reception area of the conference into a rainbow of colors. A great
place to start each conference day!

Once again a big "THANK YOU" to all the organizers and volunteers for such a
great event! I can't wait to come to Portland in 2016:

And now back to posting about restaurants, beer, and other stuff not directly
related to the name of this series...
