Attending conferences and sightseeing are activities that make you hungry. Good
thing that Cardiff has quite a lot to offer to help you get around this
"issue". [Welsh Cakes][wc] and [Shepherd's Pie][sp] were just a few of the
awesome things I could taste during my short stay in Cardiff, that and nearly
enough lamp ðŸ˜‰

During my stay I gave following restaurants and bars a try:

* [The Clink][tc] is a restaurant partially staffed by prison inmates on their
  way back to the life outside. Great food and a really unique experience. It
  well deserves its #1 spot in the
  [restaurant listing for Cardiff on TripAdvisor][1]. I've been there twice now
  and I'd always return given the chance.
* [BrewDog Cardiff][bd]: For me personally *the* beer hub in Cardiff. Huge menu, very
  nice staff and awesome beer. I'm just sad that I didn't try the burgers
  here. Every single one that passed our table looked delicious.
* [ZeroDegrees][zd] is another microbrewery but this one also offers a wider
  range of dishes in their extremly modern looking restaurant. Not a big
  selection of beers (one per category) but good! Quite a nice place for larger
  groups as it isn't as noisy as some of the restaurants in that area.
* [Urban Tap House][uth] is also a microbrewery just a couple of minutes away
  from both ZeroDegrees and BrewDog with a huge selection of beers that perhaps
  focused a little more on US Pale Ales and related types. Very nice but esp. on
  game days (or when One Direction is in town) it is far too full for my
  liking. They also have some more private rooms upstrairs, though.
* [Old Arcade][oa]: As the Urban Tap House only served food until 8pm we had to
  move on and found this SA Brains pub... and yes, it looked like a pub as I
  remember them down to the weird smell of spilled ale ðŸ˜‰ That being said, the
  staff was extremely nice, the beer was what you expect to get at a chain pub
  and the food (Shepherd's Pie + Fudge Cake) was excellent. I'm still sad we
  only got there once.
* [Cardiff Cottage][co] is another SA Brains pub that we visited a couple of
  days before The Old Arcade. Also something you'd recognize as a pub with the
  typical beers and good food. The burger was really good ðŸ˜Š Despite all that I
  simply didn't feel that comfortable here, but I also don't really know why...
* [The Mount Stuart][tms]: Another chain pub (JD Wetherspoon this time) but this
  one lives off its location. Sitting right at the heart of Cardiff Bay you have
  a nice view from the terrace over the quay and sea. They have a nice selection
  of beers and an attractive menu, but the pulled pork burger I had was, sadly,
  just a big disappoinment. I would go there again for the view alone but
  probably eat somewhere (or definitely at least something) else.
* [National Museum Cardiff][nmc]: Ok, that's a weird one. DjangoCon Europe had
  its big dinner at the National Museum's Grand Hall. The setting was stunning
  and the meal was simply excellent (great lamp!). Probably one of the best
  conference dinners I've had so far ðŸ˜Š

... and Costa, Starbucks and pretty much every coffee/chai shop we could find ðŸ˜‰
