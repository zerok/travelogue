Christoph and I (and on the last two days also Barbara) only had a couple of
days to explore the city but we managed to find (with the help of Baptiste)
quite a few nice pubs, restaurants, coffee shops, and bars I'd like to share
with you here:


## SpÃ­ler

While on the train(s) from Graz to Budapest I checked Tripadvisor and other
sites for recommendations regarding where to get some simple food and drinks in
Budapest and somehow stumbled upon the [SpÃ­ler Pub][sp]. It's basically a
gastropub but with a nice selection of local brews and rather unorthodox dishes
in it's "Shanghai" half ;-) Situated in the center of a district full of pubs,
bars, restaurants the beer garden there is just perfect to just sit down, eat
something, have a chat and watch people. Alongside the really nice beer menu
they also have great cocktails and good music. Just stay away from the Mangalica
sausage if you're hungry. One sausage with fries is simply not enough unless you
combine it with a pizza or a burger ;-)

## Szimpla Kert

On our second evening we went to the [Szimpla Kert][kert] which is ... kind of
hard to describe. Think of it as a food court in an old factory courtyard
with bars and grills all around and a beer garden in the heart of it. In my
opinion something you simply have to see when you visit Budapest. Just don't let
the entrance turn you away. From the outside it looks like a building that
should probably have been demolished a long time ago ðŸ˜‰

Only downside: They don't have any fries to go alongside their huge burgers. On
the other hand, they are huge so that you don't need fries ðŸ˜‰

## Szimpla KÃ¡vÃ©zÃ³

As the larger Szimpla Kert didn't have a big selection of local beers we set out
to try the much smaller [Szimpla KÃ¡vÃ©zÃ³][sk] bar just a few streets east of it.
Sadly, we visited on a day with half of the beers having been removed from the
blackboard-menu but there were still three left we could give a try: a premium
lager, a red ale, and a rauch weizen. All three turned out to be quite good so
we didn't have the rather strange establishment early ðŸ˜‰

Strange because this bar has a living-room-like ground-floor with old-looking
furniture and a larger bar, as well as a much smaller first floor reachable via
rather shaky stairs. The upper floor has been given over to its visitors pens
and knifes as some kind of guestbook. At first it looked rather ugly but somehow
we couldn't stop checking all the walls to see where previous visitors were
coming from ðŸ˜€

## Blonder Pub

[Blonder Pub][bp] was also on my list simply because it claimed to have local
brews. Which they had and the one I got (a quite dark one getting dangerously
close to a stout) was quite good. Other than that, the pub itself had sadly only
very little atmosphere. Perhaps it was just on that evening that it was very
bright inside and us being the only customers, but it, sadly, simply looked
rather bland and boring. Because of all that it didn't make my list of places I
will likely return in the near future.

## 400

We originally went to [400][] because we had heard that they served a great
Serbian mixed grill plate for two people that should be enough for even more.
Sadly, it turned out that the plate was still rather small which either one of
us could have finished on his or her own. Also the quality simply wasn't there.
Everything was rather bland but still fatty, far beyond what is the norm with
dishes from that region (unless that's the difference to the Croatian cuisine ðŸ˜•).
At least the Tiramisu I had as a dessert was very good.

On that evening [Telenor][tn] also had some kind of promotion going on where a
handful of marketing people were running all around the restaurant to tell you
how awesome their network was. Well, any open network that doesn't let me get on
a secure VPN isn't even worth printing a single flyer in my book. Thanks for the
SPAM!

## Coffee shops and breakfast

Just for completeness' sake here a list or all the non-starbucks coffee shops we
tried:

* [Budapest Baristas][bb]: Small but extremely friendly and great Tiramisu.
  Sadly no hot drinks except for coffee and plain tea.
* [My Little Melbourne Coffee][mlbc]: Even smaller and they only serve chai
  latte if combined with a coffee unless you tell them otherwise. Weird but very
  interesting. Would definitely go there again.
* [KÃ©t Szerecsen][ks]: Bar/restaurant/cafÃ© that serves and awesome breakfast
  with real hot chocolate! Exactly the right kind of place you need before
  starting a long day!
