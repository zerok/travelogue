Seems like [Air Canada](https://www.aircanada.com/) and the rest of the Star
Alliance really don't get along that well. Last year I had some minor issues
with Austrian and Air Canada where I couldn't get a ticket for a connection
flight operated by AC when doing the check-in for the whole trip via
[Austrian](http://www.austrian.com/). I had to go to a service desk in Toronto
just to pick up that ticket on an already close call.

This time I can't even do the check-in for any of the flights on
[lufthansa.com](http://www.lufthansa.com). All I get is this nice error message
(11am-ish) informing me that due to special services I may have booked I should
consult a service desk:

So I went to check my booking details and there is no such a things a booked
special service or mobility requirement...

Calling the Austrian (the country) service line of Lufthansa resulted in me
getting a new phone number in Germany that I should call ... which didn't accept
calls from Austria. The Austrian support person couldn't help me because they
don't seem to have access to the actual online booking system.

So, e-mail it is then. Sadly, getting an answer there will probably take them
longer than the ~11 hours I've left before boarding... I guess I will see in the
morning what is going on there.

Apart from that the preparations are going pretty smoothly. Half of the suitcase
is prepared, all relevant devices are being charged right now, and I have enough
Aspirin for a whole family. What can go wrong now?! :-)

I even prepared a note to remind myself to change the timezone on my camera once
in Canada!
