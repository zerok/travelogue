+++

Whenever I get the chance to be in a large city, I try finding a Mexican
restaurant. Graz just recently got one but I didn't get to try out yet and
before that the situation here was bleak. So, I try to use every opportunity for
a nice Taco or Burrito ðŸ˜Š After a whole day of sprinting (or actually one
workshop and then reading books and preparing my trip to FOSDEM) I managed to
convince a couple of friend to give
[Rose's Cantina](http://www.amsterdam.info/restaurants/rosescantina/) a try.

When we arrived, the restaurant was already quite full but the staff opened a
second room just for us, which we had to ourselves ... for like 5 minutes ðŸ˜‰ This
place is simply *huge* and has a great and comfortable atmosphere but also seems
to be rather popular. Definitely good signs!

In general, the staff was very friendly and quick. They have a small but tasty
selection of Mexican and Dutch beers, good companions for the very tasty
Enchilada I had. Very spicy but not too hot to cover all the other tastes that
should be part of that meal.

For dessert I had a chili-chocolate cake. Perhaps the spices in the main course
had destroyed some taste buds but the cake tasted a bit bland for chili and
chocolate. It wasn't bad but simply not memorable and/or worth its price to
me. Perhaps I should simply have got a cocktail instead.

Well, ... I did that anyway, as the menu was simply too inviting ðŸ˜Š Personally,
I'd simply skip the dessert menu and go for the cocktails right away. They are
well mixed and (at least to me) not watered down and they have some quite fancy
ones there, too.

Nothing there was cheap. Amsterdam, in general, is a bit more expensive compared
to some other cities I've been to recently, but the evening was well worth the
final bill. Rose's Cantina is absolutely a place I will consider again whenever
I come back to the Dutch capital.
