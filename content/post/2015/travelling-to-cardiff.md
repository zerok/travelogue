When trying to get to Cardiff last year for [DjangoWeekend][2] I decided to go
via train to Vienna, then hop onto a plane to London and from there take a bus
to Cardiff. Apart from having to sleep at the airport in Vienna that plan was
actually pretty good. This time around I, luckily, could improve on it by
getting a flight from Graz to Vienna early in the morning, so I didn't have
[lie awake at an airport][1].

It also reduced my travel-time incl. lay-overs significantly to something around
10 hours from Graz Airport to Cardiff Bus Station. Thanks to the uneventful
[National Express][3] bus-ride I could even get at least another 30 minutes of
sleep so unlike last year I could walk through Cardiff in the afternoon without
looking and acting like a zombie ðŸ˜‰

Also, unlike Baptiste, I still can't report any problems with using that bus
company and will probably continue using them on my next trip back to Wales'
capital; whenever that may be.

Perhaps the only surprise this time around was the Cardiff was about to close
the Central Bus Station for [renovation][4] a day before I was about to leave
for Graz. My return ticket already a notice on it that my was was supposed to
leave from Sophia Gardens without any information on the National Express
website or anywhere else where exactly that was (satellite images on Google Maps
solved that mystery). Luckily, it turned out that the timeframe on the
renovation was a bit too optimistic and so I didn't have to walk through half of
Cardiff to get to my bus.

On the way Wales there also seems to have been an accident in Newport so the bus
took a detour over the Second Severn Crossing while using the Severn Bridge on
the way back. Finally I got to see both of them ðŸ˜ƒ
