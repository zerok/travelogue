The image above should already say it all: We finally made it to a Poutineville
and had some awesome Poutine! What you see up there is a classic combination
with extra cheese, pulled pork, and philly steak, au gratin, of course ;-) That
one serving would have been more than enough for a whole day if shared with
someone else. Obviously we didn't do that ...

Since the restaurant from last year is still closed because of a fire in the
neighborhood we went to the Poutineville in Beaubien. It's not as nice as the
other one but the meal was just as (ful-)filling :-) Compared to the Ontario St
location this one looks more like a very simple diner which distracts from the
awesome food you can get here. The [Ikea London poster][1] right next to our
table didn't help either.
