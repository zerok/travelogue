I love Brazilian steak houses. I mean, what can be better than all-you-can-eat
steak? I had previously been to [Espetus][1] in San Francisco which I - to this
day - consider the best steak expierence ever.

After hearing tons of praise from coworkers and friends we decided to give Fogo
de Chão in Chicago a try to see if it is as good as Espetus and the other Fogo
de Chão location Ulrich had tried in Los Angeles.

For once, the restaurant is huge. I'd say at least twice as big as
Espetus. Other than that, the first impressions are similar. There is a huge
salad bar which also serves a handful of warm meals and Prosciutto. I don't
know how the salmon fits in there but I simply ignored it. I was here for the
steak and for not much else, anyway :-)

While the meat was great, it was mostly dry and the variety was not that
big. Probably the best was the bacon wrapped chicken and beef and the beef
rips. The mashed potatoes with garlic were rather bland and you could barely
taste the garlic, while the grilled bananas and polenta were quite tasty.

On the beer-side of things they had a great Brazilian dark lager and some good
light ales. They also had an excellent Caipirinha but for $13 it better be good
;-)

In general, I enjoyed the evening but it was definitely a very expensive one
and I went home a bit disappointed. I simply had expected better meat and more
variety. With 20% lower prices it would have been excellent but so I have to
critizise details I would normally not deem relevant.
