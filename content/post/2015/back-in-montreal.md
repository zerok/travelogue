12 hours of airports and flying (1h from Graz to Frankfurt, 8h from Frankfurt to
Graz and about 3 hours lay-over) and two taxi rides and I'm finally in Montréal
again!

Luckily, nothing went wrong the flights except that Ulrich's and my seat
selections were somehow lost. Not a big deal but just weird. For lunch I had
probably the most artificial salmon of my life. You know that frozen salmon you
use a microwave to heat up? Cut that into small cubes, put some really bad pasta
next to it and you know what it tasted like. I also haven't heard back from
Lufthansa yet regarding my check-in issues on Wednesday except that it is now
being shuffled around between various support departments.

The Travelodge is still mostly the same, albeit some of the rooms (including
mine) have received a bit of an update with a completely new bathroom. I will
definitely write a review once I've checked out again :-)

After checking in at the hotel it was already 2pm so we didn't have that much
time before the bagging session was set to begin. As PyCon is expecting
something between 2500 and 2700 attendees this year there are a lots of swag
bags to fill, which is done on this last afternoon before the main conference by
volunteers from the community. It took us nearly 3 hours to prepare all these
bags but thanks to a great team effort (and awesome organisation with worker
channels) we made it!

Sadly, this all turned out to be quite exhausting and I was coughing hard for
the rest of the evening. Not that this stopped us from getting some dinner at
the nearby St. Hubert's. This is starting to become a tradition ;-)

... and so is getting some doughnuts from the [IGA](https://www.iga.net/en/)
grocery store right next to it!

After a good night's sleep I at least feel healthy enough to attend this
morning's keynotes and talks. I really hope that lasts. ACC, Aspirin and
Isla Moos should help there ;-)
