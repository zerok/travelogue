Yesterday was supposed to be Poutine-day... Sadly, on our way to
[Poutineville][1] in Ontario St multiple firefighter trucks passed us and the
direction they were heading in didn't look good for us. The closer we got to the
restaurant the denser the smoke cloud became and we soon had to switch to one of
the side streets to proceed.

From where we stood we saw that either Poutineville itself or one of the
neighboring buildings was on fire. A couple of minutes after we've left
[@Poutineville](https://twitter.com/PoutineVille) tweeted this:

The fire must have started right when Ulrich and I had left the hotel for a nice
dinner. That's just plain weird :-/ Luckily, it looks like [no one was hurt][2].

In the end we walked back to the hotel and stopped at a [Les 3 Brasseurs][3] on
the way. The Poutine we got there definitely wasn't bad but we're still looking
forward to making our way to one of the other Poutineville restaurants in
Montr√©al during the next couple of days.
