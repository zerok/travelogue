When growing up in Klagenfurt I oftentimes went to a restaurant chain called
"Wienerwald" which served excellent chicken meals. Sadly, over the years it
morphed into a McDonald's clone and become less and less popular.

When coming to Montréal for the first time last year, Ulrich and I went to a
St-Hubert restaurant very close to our hotel which basically offered the same
style of meals as good old Wienerwald but better ... and it became a PyCon
tradition. Any place that serves good roasted chicken and beer is a no-brainer
for me.

Again, on the very first evening in the city we went there and (again) weren't
disappointed. I had half a chicken with fries which was delicious while Ulrich
tried a pulled pork sandwich. At first I thought that my meal wasn't completely
done but after closer inspection it turned out to be completely fine.

The whole restaurant was filled to capacity but the staff (and our primary wait
Alexis in particular) were still very responsive and we didn't have to wait long
for anything, including a table which we got without reservation within a couple
of minutes.

The only regret I have is that I couldn't drink another beer or eat a desert
thanks to my throat acting up, partially due to the air conditioning being
turned up to maximum here. It's definitely one of the places I will miss when
PyCon moves on after two years of being in Montréal.
