Being for the first time in Poznan and not being able to find a cheap Accor
hotel for some reason, it took me quite some time to find a nice place to stay
at for PolyConf. In fact I had booked a cheap hostel until about 5 days before
the conference until I read a review that showed the beds at that place, which
made me reconsider. Luckily, only about 10 minutes later I had a room
reservation at [Hotel Traffic](http://www.hoteltraffic.pl/).

Hotel Traffic is situated right next to one of Poznan's large shopping malls at
the southern end of the inner city. Actually, a rather nice location as its only
about 5 minutes away from the main station and the shopping mall is just awesome
with a nice park (with beach chairs all over it!) right next to it.

What's weird about the building the hotel is in, though, is that it doesn't
offer a dedicated entrance for hotel guests. You rather have to walk though the
halls of the "Lok. OÅ›rodek szkolenia kierowcÃ³w", which seems to be some kind of
paramilitary organisation if I got that right ... yeah ... Well, at least their
reception is open 24/7, so there's that.

Think about it as a very modern hostel that luckily also offers quite affordable
full-fledged guest rooms and feels kind of sponsored by Ikea (which is *not a
bad thing*). My room was not huge but absolutely enough for me to sleep well and
get some work done. It definitely helped that power-sockets seem to be cheap in
Poland and I had more than enough to not even think about unpacking my power
strip! It took me a night to get used to the bed but then it was absolutely OK.

In general I could only find two downsides of my room: It was out to the streets
and there was a casino nearby so high-rollers had to drive their stupid noisy
Lamborghinis and Ferraris around *all the time*. Combined with no
air-conditioning at summer temperatures it's kind of annoying ðŸ˜‰

The other downside was the water boiler that was built into the wall between
bathroom and hallway as it was quite loud and wasn't able to keep the shower's
water temperature steady.

Both really minor gripes in my book for such an affordable hotel! Next time in
Poznan, if I don't find a nice offer at one of the bigger chain hotels, I will
definitely consider it again!
