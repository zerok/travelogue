I haven't been to a cinema since Chicago but I did make an exception to my "no
cinema" policy for the new Star Wars movie while being at the Congress in
Hamburg. There is only so much coding you can do without having to watch a movie
ðŸ˜‰

Good thing that there was a big cinema right next door with
[CinemaxX Hamburg-Dammtor](https://www.cinemaxx.de/Programm/AktuellesProgramm?SwitchCinemaId=10).
Luckily, they also had the movie in English but sadly then only with 3D. I had
also completely forgotten how much the ads they show before the feature film
actually suck: TV-ads with a factor 2 or more in the stupidity-category. Not
even the trailers were interesting with the exception of the new Disney movie
[Zootopia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY73vFGhSVk).

After about 30 minutes Star Wars finally started and despite the 3D it was very
entertaining! Since you're probably either in the "I have seen it already" or
the "I don't want to see it" camp of people out there, there is no reason to
write about the plot here, I guess ðŸ˜‰ For me it was simply entertaining. I'm not
really into Star Wars but I've seen the previous movies (except for Episode 3
IIRC) and read a bunch of books from the extended universe, but that's about
it. It's simply not my style of SciFi/Fantasy, but that doesn't detract from its
entertainment value for me ðŸ˜ƒ

That being said, I think that's it again for a couple of months when it comes to
seeing a theatre from the inside. But who knows, perhaps I'll make an exception
for [Deadpool](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1431045/?ref_=cs_ov_tt)...
