OK, not strictly from above but close enough ;-) Last week Ulrich and I visited
two of the better known skyscrapers in Chicago: First the John Hancock Center
([360ยบ Chicago][c]) and on our last day the Willis Tower ([Skydeck][s]).

Both of them are absolutely worth visiting and don't think about skipping one
just because they are both skyscrapers. From either you will have quite a unique
view over the city with the John Hancock Center (JHC) being closer to the lake,
affording you a nice view over the northern areas of the city and the Navy
Pier. Willis Tower (WT) on the other hand offers a great view to the south and
over the other "high-risers" in Chicago.

Tickets for either of them cost about $20 which is fine, but right now you'd get
more for that on the WT simply because about a quarter of the 360ยบ view promised
in the brochure for the JHC is currently under renovation and therefore not
accessible.

The Skydeck is also embedded into a small museum telling the story of the
building which we kind of missed in the 360ยบ Chicago experience. That being
said: If you're up there for the view this doesn't really matter. And it didn't
;-)

As you can see from the pictures above, we visited the Willis Tower at night and
the JHC during the day simply because we kind of expected the closeness to the
water with the latter to offer us quite a nice view over the lake. That worked
really well for us but make sure you pick a really sunny day :-)
