+++

Over the two years that Ulrich and I have come to Montréal for PyCon we've
found quite a few nice places to have some awesome beers. Last year that mostly
meant [Les 3 Brasseurs][l3b] as well as the great locally brewed beers you can
get at smaller restaurants like [Dinette Triple Crown][dtc]. This year we
expanded on that by finally making our way to Le Cheval Blanc, the McAuslan
Brewery - or its Annexe pub to be precise - and Le Saint-Bock.


## Le Saint-Bock

Situated right next to the Université du Québec à Montréal on rue Saint Denis
this combination of a lounge, beer garden, garage bar has usually around 40
beers of various micro-breweries (including themselves) on
tap. [Le Saint-Bock][lsb] is probably not the right place if you want to talk
to someone as the noise level at least in the entrance area is quite high, but
the selection of beers will probably still make it worth your visit.

They mostly serve IPA and stronger typed beers so your milage may vary here. It
certainly did for me. That being said: If you enjoy stronger beer it should be
on your list.


## Le Cheval Blanc

[Le Cheval Blanc][lcb] is a pub also in the Saint-Denis neighborhood with a
slightly dark-red/nightclub look. They have around 10 beers on tap ranging from
a Blonde with 5% all the way up to Barley Wine with devastating 10%. Besides
the latter the Ambrée at 5% was also extremely tasty. If you are in the area
it's definitely worth a visit. Don't let the neighboring buildings turn you
away.

## Annexe

Same goes for the [Annexe pub of the McAuslan brewery][ama]. We took a bus to
about a kilometre out from the pub and walked the rest through first a run-down
residential area with dirt everywhere followed by an ambandonned industrial
zone. Definitely not the place you want to hang out during the night. Luckily,
the last 200m to the venue were through a cleaner residential area (except for
an old factory building right next to the pub, of course). The Annexe itself
was probably in the end one of my favorite bars in Montréal. They have only a
small selection of beers on tap but why do you need anything but the Abricot
and the Ambrée?! It was also hockey-night and the crowd mostly consisted of
Canadians fans. Fortunately, they won that match and so there was lots of
cheering going on all the time :-) It was simply a clean and friendly place
with nice and fast service!

## Les 3 Brasseurs

On our last evening we also made it back to Les 3 Brasseurs in rue Saint Paul
Est. As always, great beers and this month they also had a very tasty special:
A Begian Wheatbear called "Witteke". Oh, we will definitely miss this brewery
:-)

In general, Montréal is a great place to get awesome beer. I'm pretty sure
we've still only scratched the surface of all the beers that are brewed in the
larger city area but what we've had, was well worth it!
