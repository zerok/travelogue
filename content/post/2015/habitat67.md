Back in Montréal we spent quite some time to get to a building complex called
[Habitat 67][h67], so I thought it was worth writing a little bit about it and
how we got there:

Habitat 67 is a residential complex right next to the Saint Lawrence River in
Montréal constructed as part of the Expo 67 fair. It kind of feels like
something out of Qbert but with holes in it, being a complex made out of mostly
identical cubes stacked all over each other. If it weren't build out of that
brownish concrete that is favoured in Canada it would actually look amazing, but
even so it is quite spectacular.

According to [Wikipedia][wp] it houses around 150 apartments (with it's
architect, [Moshe Safdie][ms], still owning one of them) but back in 1967 it was
actually a pavilion for the World Expo. It's simply amazing how much roof area
you can get out of it, with each apartment being connected to one terrace!

We only approached it from one side because as tourists walking through a
residential complex simply felt weird to me, but I can only assume that the view
from up there and from the other side onto the river must be spectacular!

The downside of this complex is how hard it was to get there. We approached it
from the north from Île Sainte-Hélène where the closes metro station was
located. A long walk later over the Pont de la Concorde we finally made it to
the habitat. From the south you can get to it via a combination of private and
public busses.

To be honest, the walk to it was more interesting than Habitat 67 itself from
the outside, but that was to be expected. At least we saw some of the nature on
Île Sainte-Hélène waking up again after the winter.
