Just for completeness' sake here also a list of all the sights Barbara,
Christoph, and I visited during our 1.5 days of actually having time for doing
that after attending JSConf Budapest.

## Sziklatemplom (Cave Church)

within GellÃ©rt Hill. Usually not someone who enjoys visiting churches this one
was extremely impressive simply because it was so ... simple. Just some benches
and altars and enough atmosphere to relax no matter what you were thinking about
before.

Sadly, we were not allowed to take some pictures from the inside but at least
got an audio guide. As with pretty much every single audio-guide I've ever had
the headphones were crappy and you could hear the narator switch papers in her
script ðŸ˜‰ That being said, if you want to learn basically everything there is to
know about this place, listening to all the stations will probably give you a
good start. We gave it up after about 20 minutes...

## Citadella

Situated on top of GellÃ©rt Hill is this [fortress/memorial][cit] constructed in
1851 affords you an awesome view over Pest and Danube. It's quite a hike to get
up there (at least from the South) but it was definitely forth it. It's also one
of these places that is completely full with tourists (like us) ðŸ˜‰

Two days before coming up there, Christoph and I had already explored the East
side of the hill after crossing the river on Elisabeth Bridge, which is also
were we left the hill on our way to the Fisherman's Bastion and Buda Castle. It
might have been the easier way but so we found the cave church.

## Buda Castle

Sadly not much to report here as we didn't actually took any tour of the
[castle][ca] (having been to other castles and palasts all over Europe and
finding their interiors far less impressive than walking just around them). But
this one didn't disappoint! It's a nice mix of 19th, Baroque and medieval style
which is quite unique in my book. Being on the way from the Citadella to the
Fisherman's Bastion definitely helped, though ðŸ˜‰

Especially the northern parts of the complex were full with tourists thanks to
some small restaurants and the [Hill Funicular][fun] being situated in that area.

Probably the most famous of Budapest's sights is the the
[Fisherman's Bastion][fb]. It was also the last one on our day tour as we were
starting to feel the heat, sun, and hills. It's basically an immense terrace
being home to the Matthias Church (which we didn't enter either) and has a
walkable wall. For the first segment of that you actually have to pay but not so
for the most northern one ... which kind of doesn't make that much
sense. \*shrugs\*

## Parlament

The [Hungarian parliament building][parl] is definitely one of the most
impressive government edifice I've ever seen. Situated on an immense square with
lots of green and various memories surrounding it it was probably the sight that
surprised me the most. Just a beauty!

## Columbo statue

It's weird but kind of funny: There is a statue for the TV detective Columbo
played by Peter Falk in the Falk Miksa utca north of the parliament. Complete
with coat, head-scratching, and dog.

Unveiled in 2014 (so quite a bit after the actor's death) the reasons for its
installation are a bit of a mystery. The [Atlas Obscura][cs] has a nice write-up
about it.

## Ronald Reagan statue

Pretty much the same distance from the parliament but to the south there is the
statue of former US president Ronald Reagan. [Erected in 2011][rr] it acts a
memorial for his work of moving east and west closer together around the
collapse of the USSR.

Well ... obviously ðŸ˜‰ You can't really escape them and you definitely shouldn't
esp. at night. Use all of them, take pictures, enjoy the view! Probably my
favorite one was the [SzÃ©chenyi Chain Bridge][scc] which was also the first
permanent bridge across the Danube. Perhaps one of the best places to be at
night as a tourist!
