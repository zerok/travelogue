Getting back to Cardiff I couldn't avoid visiting the [Doctor Who Experience][1]
once again. And just like the who itself the exhibition has undergone a
transformation with the new doctor. More than before it is focused on sets,
costumes and the likes from the current series. If you haven't watched it yet,
it is hard to recommend it. There is still enough material from older seasons
but I'd say about a quarter might end up being a spoiler for you.

Last year one of my criticisms was that especially the "interactive experience"
felt a bit immature. That has changed now and I enjoyed it quite a bit ðŸ˜Š And it
is spoiler-free, so there is that.

The fan shop was, sadly, worse than last year's, though. Most of the motives
printed onto t-shirts, cups and hoodies were completely generic and boring. Gone
was the "Don't Blink" cup.

Ulrich guided me to a gem I had missed last year: [Ianto][3]'s Shrine, situated right
where the entrance to Torchwood 3 would have been in the show ... before it was
blown up, anyway.

Sure, the show has been off-air for quite a while now and Ianto has been dead
even longer but I really hope that people managing the [Mermaid Quay][2] won't
remove this anytime soon. It's probably the most niche you can get but if you
like Doctor Who and Torchwood, it is a must-see. So much fan-love ðŸ˜ƒ

This year, I also wanted to do the Doctor Who Walking Tour through Cardiff Bay
to visit even more of the filming locations but, sadly, once again couldn't make
it due to time constraints. Hopefully there will be a DjangoWeekend soon again
so that I can give it another try ðŸ˜‰
