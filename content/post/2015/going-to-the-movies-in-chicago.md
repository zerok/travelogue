While in Chicago two movies we were quite interested were still in the
theaters: [Fast & Furious 7][ff7] and [Ex Machina][em]. Luckily, we quickly
found two cinemas in walking distance of our hotel and so we made our way first
for FF7 to the [IMAX at Navy Pier][imax] and two days later to the
[AMC River East 21][amc] for Ex Machina.


## IMAX at Navy Pier

Well, the IMAX, sadly, was quite a disappointment. This was by far the oldest
looking one I've ever been to and the seats were far from comfortable. For
nearly USD 20 per seat I had expected a bit more. The location is great but
that doesn't really help when watching a very entertaining movie in
unconfortable chairs. To loosely quote TODO: "The discomfort is real here."
The screen itself wasn't that fresh anymore, either. You could sometimes see
the audio equipment behind it and there were some vertical stripes visible.

Embedded in the entrance-section of the pier there were also tons of snack and
fast-food shops but none seemed to be open after the movie and/or looked all
that inviting. In general, that IMAX wouldn't be my first address for watching
movies in Chicago.


## AMC River East 21

The AMC on the other hand was far more modern with comfortable seating for USD
13 and a box office you could hardly miss. (There was actually a sign at the
IMAX next to the snack counter that said something like "The box office is
behind you.".)  But, holy crap, advertising and infomercials in US cinemas are
aweful! It's one thing having to watching some commercials for Yahoo!'s latest
try at staying relevant but then multiple *lengthy* video reminders that people
should silence their cell phones?! But that was all forgotten once the movie
had started. And what a great movie it was :-)

Part of the AMC was also a bowling arena and sports-bar but after reading some
reviews on Yelp we opted to ignore it. We were not really in the mood for
paying a lot for potentially microwaved food.
