Every year I travel around the world to attend awesome tech conferences and
explore the cities they are hosted in. Over time this has become my personal way
of "going on vacation" mostly because I simply can't stand just lying around,
doing nothing.

During these trips I like to take tons of pictures, check in whereever I can
with Foursquare or Swarm and write shorts about things I've discovered for
myself on Google+. The problem there is, that all this content is distributed on
multiple services with none of them being totally under my control. If I decide
that I don't like Swarm anymore, I'd lose all that data. Same for restaurant
reviews: The moment I ditch Tripadvisor or Yelp I have to start all over again.

Putting all that on [zerokspot.com](https://zerokspot.com) would probably have
been an option but I don't see that one as a tumblelog. On ZS I want to have
longer or at least tech-focused articles with only a few exceptions. Being on a
journey usually means that I might dump like 20 posts in a row there without any
relation that the usual content.

So I thought: Let's create a small Tumblr log where I can put all my
impressions. This way I can still use my own domain (and therefore have a way to
move away from it afterwards) and I can easily create the content from my
phone.

But then I remembered that I don't really like my phone pictures in the first
place and that I have a larger camera for a reason. Because of that the benefit
of using Tumblr over something hosted by myself kind of went away.

So here we go: This is my first attempt at making a blog about all (and not just
a summary of) the things I come across while traveling around the world using
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io). I hope you'll enjoy it :-)
