Cardiff is a beautiful city with quite a few parks and enough water-ways for a
great mix of blue and green colors throughout it. Last year I had already at
least found the entrance to [Cardiff Castle][1] but this year I finally made it
in. And it was so worth it! The tunnels below the outer walls alone would have
been enough. Back in WW2 they were used as bunkers against air raids and you can
see old beds, propaganda pictures and reconstructed rooms from that era down
there. All while listening to bombing-sounds from a tape. There is also only
the bare minimum of artifical light which made the atmosphere even more
dense. Minimalistic but perhaps also because of that extremely impressive.

At the center of the castle is the so-called "Norman shell keep" from the 12th
century which you can scale to the very top. The view from up there both to the
other areas of the castle and down to the inner courtyard of the keep itself is
well worth the effort (and the tiny steps).

If you want to you can also pay additional Â£3 and get a [House Tour][2],
showing the living area of the Butes from the 18-20th century.

The castle is surrounded by a beautiful park and the famous Animal Wall which
you shouldn't miss either. Some of the animals there have quite unique looks on
their faces ðŸ˜‰ (esp. the bear).

want to relax in the sun or enjoy the numerous restaurants, you will find
something there.

Cardiff Bay is also home to the Millenium Centre, which I once again didn't
visit beyond taking a picture from the outside ðŸ˜©

But on your way there from the castle make a short stop on Hayes pl. to get some
refreshments from tne nearby Tesco and to take a look at the beautiful
["Alliance" sculpture][3].
