Getting to Budapest from Austria is pretty easy: Get on one or two trains and
your are there. As most longer routes are now serviced by Railjets it's even an
extremely pleasant ride with power outlets and more leg-room than you actually
need! I'm kidding, there is no such thing as too much leg-room ;-)

So after about 5 hours we reached our destination with the Budapest-Keleti
station at the eastern edge of the city center. And what a weird building that
one is! The place in front of it has been recently renovated and also the
building itself looks extremely nice from the outside. You'd imagine that it is
full of shops, counters, ... and stuff. But on the inside it is actually just a
huge empty hall with small shops on the outer walls and in the basement.

Christoph and I had expected the weather to be rather unfriendly and cold but
what awaited us was a summer day with the temperature to match that. Since we
were both quite tired, though, we only made it to [St. Stephen's Basilica][1]
and then to a nice dinner at the [Sp√≠ler pub][2]. There we met up with
[Baptiste][3] who told us everything we needed to know about the city and where
and where not to go!

Sp√≠ler itself was really a nice evening experience thanks to quite a diverse
menu and local brews. Only downside: We had to order about have of our stuff
twice because somehow the respective first one was forgotten ... But otherwise üëç
Also because they have a really tasty orange-ginger-honey beer called Rizmajer
Gy√∂mb√©r s√∂r!
