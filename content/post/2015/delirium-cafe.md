After the first conference day (ok, technically it was the second but my first)
Andreas, Lasse, Ulrich, and I wanted to get something to eat and drink before
joining the rest of the attendees on the boat party. Turn out, only like 200m
down the street there was a really nice beer-bar called
[DÃ©lirium CafÃ©](http://deliriumcafeamsterdam.nl/).

They have an extremely impressive beer menu which actually comes in a binder!
According to their website they have around 700 beers available, a menu so large
that their website sports a
[search dialog](http://deliriumcafeamsterdam.nl/bieren/) ðŸ˜ƒ While most of these
beers are by other breweries, they also have some products of their own,
including the amazing
[Delirium Tremens](http://deliriumcafeamsterdam.nl/bieren/delirium-tremens/)
which is now in the top-5 for me!

Sadly, neither the service nor the food can keep up with that. They are both
good but not as stellar as the beer menu ðŸ˜‰ The burger will definitely keep you
afloat while making your way through the beer menu and the staff is friendly but
a bit slow.

Initially, we couldn't find a table and therefore went for one that had a
reservation sign on it for in 1h30m. After about 15 minutes of failing to
attract the attention of the staff we started to get worried about our time
window ðŸ˜‰ Luckily, it all worked out and we had a great evening (and eventually
even returned after the conference boat-tour/party for a good-night-drink).

It's pretty much the kind of bar/restaurant I love. There are TVs for some
live-events but not too prominent, there is enough room for everyone to move
around, the tables are comfortable, ... It's probably the first place I'll go to
(after the hotel room) when I get back to Amsterdam eventually.
