- The purpose of this talk is to increase the level of trust in this community.
- There will be no questions on stage as the topic is rather sensitive but there
  is a Q&A opportunity later on on the library.
- None of us are alone.
- It may look like everyone else is fine but many have their own problems.
- No matter how successful they seem, they might spend a lot of energy on
  keeping it together.
- 1 in 4 struggle with their well-being to the degree that it can be diagnosed.
- Last year there were free counselling sessions at DjangoCon Europe.
- People have to realize, that they are not alone and that there are places
  where they are not judged.

## Steps we can take

- Before you help others, help yourself.
- Helping others doesn't necessarily help you.
- "What's in it for me" test is not necessarily selfish but necessary and
  healthy.
- Think about what you hear every time you fly: Put the mask on first before
  helping others.
- It's ok to say "no". Just because you can doesn't mean that you should. It's
  hard but having clear priorities is important.
- The result has to be sustainable. Short-term satisfaction should not
  negatively influence the long-term goal (staying healthy).

- What you do isn't equal to who you are.
- Some jobs don't have a clear finish-line. So when do you know, when you're
  done? Validation often has to be subjective feedback from peers and not
  through the finished project.
- No matter how many times you hear that you can be honest, it is hard to
  convince your mind. Don't let your fears paralyze you.

## Patterns to overcommitment

- We have to recongize the reasons for overcommitment
- The Github contribution graph and other tools like that are actually not
  helpful as they usually don't really indicate what went on in the background
  to make the contribution even possible.
- These graphs push people to overcommitment, to keep going.

## Asking for help

- Always ask for help, ask questions.
- The Django sprints are the perfect place for that, so don't be shy. You can
  always ask.
- Asking for help is not the same thing as failing. It's not the same as
  admitting that you can't do it alone.
- If the issues are affecting your life, they are real. Ignoring them doesn't
  mean that they don't exist.
- Feellings don't have to make sense; they are not rational. That doesn't mean
  that they can't affect your life. They will.
- It's not ok to make fun of you because of that. If someone does, they are
  wrong, not you.
- It's ok to ask for help, because we are a community.

## The community can help

- There are tons of programmes within the Django community that might help you:
    - Django Fellowship Program
    - Django Girls Outreach
    - Counseling at DjangoCon Europe
- Providing professional counseling is, sadly, something that an OSS project
  can't financially provide.
- "How to care for a sad person" video (?) ("Happy lil' sushi roll")
- Django Software Foundation Well-being Committee
    - Peer support with base-line communication channels
    - Should help people move past their innitial fears.
    - Contact email will be setup soon.
    - Requests will be triaged and forwarded to a person that should have
      experience in the requested field.
    - Currently with Erik, Mikey and Daniele Procida.
- Peer support is not a replacement for professional support.
- We are more loved than we think
- Even when you need to take a step back, you are still appreciated.
- Sadly, the internet is often still quite often like
