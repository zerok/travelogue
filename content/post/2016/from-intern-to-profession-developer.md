## Notes

- How can we help people finding Django later in their career?
- Career as a teacher then back to school for business and administration with
  work in Cape Town and Haiti.
- Durham's economy was based entirely around Tobacco including the university ðŸ˜‰
  With the decline of that industry the tech industry moved into these old and
  now empty factories.
- In the US there are lots of so-called code-schools which are targeted at
  people who want to switch careers.
- The code-school didn't communicate the culture of the industry and the open
  source community in general.
- Internship at Caktus Group after seeing the work they did despite having
  learnt Rails at the Code School.
- Creating opportunities for others as there are still many underrepresented
  groups that don't have groups like DjangoGirls to help.
- Why do we as a community need people from other careers to come join us?
    - Domain knowledge
    - Different ideas
- How?
    - Provide extra information. Make sure that people know what this community
      is like before joining.
    - Encourage by actively talking with people about it.
    - Create structured training groups like DjangoGirls and code-schools. Also
      provide this inside your company.
    - Mentorship as discussed in another talk. These personal relationships are
      important.
    - Create job opportunities

### Q&A

Did learning Rails before Django help with seeing the differences?

- Yes because Rails kind of provided the common grammar and Django offered a
  different vocabulary.

There is a lot of resistance towards mentorship going on for legal and financial
reasons. What could we do to change that?

- Caktus really values their role in the community. If everyone would offer
  similar mentorship the world would be much better.
- You could mitigate the risk but formulating the contracts accordingly
