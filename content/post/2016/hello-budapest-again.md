Last night after about 6 hours in trains I finally arrived in Budapest for
DjangoCon Europe! Unlike some friends I, luckily, didn't have to switch trains
but at least I got enough loud toddlers around me to prevent the trip from
becoming too productive ðŸ˜‰ That being said, I managed to finish reading
[Another Life by Peter Anghelides][al] and started writing a blog post.

After a nice walk through Budapest to my hotel I set out to meet some friends
who had already started exploring the local night-life. [MonyÃ³ Cafe & Pub][my]
was quite nice with a huge selection of craftbeer. Sadly it had to close at
midnight and so we moved on for a last round at [MÃ©lypont PresszÃ³][mp] which
(on the insight) looks like a huge living room. A much better place to have
discussions ðŸ˜ƒ
