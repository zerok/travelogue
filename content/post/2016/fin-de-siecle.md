First evening in Brussels and Ulrich and I were looking for a place to get to
know typical Belgian cuisine. The first place we went to was still closed so we
went to [Fin de SiÃ¨cle][fdc] instead. Good move, as it turns out ðŸ˜Š

Lucky for us, the restaurant is probably as un-touristy as it can get. The menu
is written on a blackboard close to the bar and is available only in French,
and, as far as I can tell, we were the only tourists there. So, we first ordered
some drinks and started working with multiple phones and battery packs to
translate the menu. Thanks to Yelp we had already seen some of the dishes they
had to offer, which made the whole quest much easier ðŸ˜ƒ The staff was extremely
patient with us here (also when we butchered the French names)!

I eventually picked a "Jamboneau" (porc knuckle with a sauce with Dijon mustard.
Extremely tasty, albeit I'm still not sure about the sides (grilled potato and
salad). The combination simply didn't fit IMHO. They also have a nice selection
of beers with 4 on draft and 15 or so bottled ones. No matter what dish you
order, you should be able to find a fitting beer ðŸ˜‰

So overall, a big thumbs-up for the Fin de SiÃ¨cle!
