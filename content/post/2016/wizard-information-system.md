## Notes

- Non-technical experience is relevant to your technical job.
- Sprints are a form of training which helps everyone in the group to get
  better. Same as any other form of training you might encounter in other areas.
- Always make it possible for users to recover from a simple mistake.
- Croud sourcing and collab. systems are a good thing ðŸ˜‰
- Documentation can save lives.
- Turning back time doesn't help you with sleep. The more time you stay awake,
  the more you have to sleep afterwards.
- There is so much you can learn from the outside world.
