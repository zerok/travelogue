As every year DjangoCon Europe also had an official party this time around at
the [Extra club][]. Saying that it was a beautiful location would be a slight
understatement, though. The club offers two floors with rooms all around a large
courtyard where the main bar is housed.

The second floor, in our case, was dedicated to board games while on the lower
floor Barbara Stahl and band played some great songs. If anyone can tell me
where I can buy the album, I'd really appreciate it ðŸ˜Š

The accustics here were great. If you wanted to chat with other folks you didn't
have to shout while still being able to listen to the band. And if you wanted a
bit more quietness, there were tons of smaller room around the courtyard for
that.

Big thanks to [Nephila][] for sponsoring drinks and the organizers for a great
event ðŸ˜Š
