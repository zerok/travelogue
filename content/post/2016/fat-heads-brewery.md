OK, this one is truly late, but I simply had to write about [Fat Head's Brewery][]
before the next time I got to Portland. Ulrich and I stumbled upon it perhaps on
our second day in town but were already on our way somewhere else, promising to
give it a try later.

And so we did the next day and ... came back multiple times. They have an
official seating area but if you don't want to wait our simply don't care you
can also just stay in the bar area, which also has tons of seating. And we
didn't care for all our visits ðŸ˜‰ They have great meals and some beers that
stormed right away to the top of my list. Just go in there and enjoy a Bumble
Berry Honey Blueberry Ale and a Kim Jong Moo Burger!

They also have a tasty pizza but if you're hungry (like after walking for
multiple hours all the way to and from the Upper Airial Tram Terminal), the
burgers and sandwiches are probably more what you need ðŸ˜‰

This is *the place* I'm looking forward the most for next year's PyCon!
