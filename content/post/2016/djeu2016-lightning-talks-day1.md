## Heroku Deployments without Git
Markus Zapke-GrÃ¼ndemann

- What if you only want to deploy a package and not a repository?
- You can build your own slug manually but that's a lot of work
- heroku-slugify helps with that
- For example useful of deployment jupyter notebooks
- Requires a requirements.txt, a Procfile and a runtime.txt for the runtime
  configuration.
- On Sunday there will be a general workshop on how to deploy Python packages
  that will also use this technique.

## Transaction Isolation Levels in Wonderland

- You usually don't want to think about them. Transactions should "just work".
- Standard SQL Isolation Levels
    - read uncommitted
    - rad committed (default for PostgreSQL and Oracle)
    - repeatable read (default for MySQL)
    - serializable
- Anomalies:
    - dirty read (can happen only in read uncommited)
    - non-repetable read (can also happen in read committed)
    - ...
- serializable
    - in the standard the general definition has been weakend to the point that
      the defined anomalies simply can't occur in this level.
- repeatable read in MySQL only applies to SELECT statements. Everything else
  behaves as in read committed.

## Mozilla Kinto
RÃ©my Hubscher

- https://github.com/Kinto/kinto
- Mozilla is using a lot of Django in the backend
- JavaSript web-apps usually need some storage, sync, push notifications,
  validation, data access management, and API handling.
- Usually, when you create a new project, you design the API, build the backend
  and consume it on the client.
- Kinto is a web database accessible via HTTP that supports snc, permissions,
  push. It also supports encyption and has an admin panel (written in ReactJS).
- This can also be used with Django in order to handle things like auth and
  validation in Kinto as implemented in Django.
