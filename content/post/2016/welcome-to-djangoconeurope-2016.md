OK, so the reason why I'm in Budapest again right now is this year's DjangoCon
Europe. Not that I need a real excuse to visit this beautiful city ðŸ˜Š

For the last couple of conferences I've tried to write a big summary post out of
all the notes I took during each talk I attended. This time, though, I'll try
something I haven't done for quite a while: Write a post for every talk. With
this I try to force myself to concentrate more during the talks and get less
distracted by things like Twitter. That and I don't want to write on paper
anymore. Let's see how this will work out ðŸ˜‰

Anyway, the venue looks great again! This year the event is hosted at the
[Budapest Music Center][bmc] in the heart of the city, only 5 minutes away from
my hotel! I'm pretty sure we will fill it up to capacity ðŸ˜Š
