During our stay in Portland we visited quite a few brewery pubs. Actually make
that ... Sooooooo many brewery pubs! I'm not sure if I should really write a
post for each and every one of them but here we go. Thanks to some
recommendations we went to the Deschutes Portland Pub right after leaving the
WriteTheDocs venue on the second day. Turns out, this is a really nice place
with a great selection of meals and tons of beers to chose from.

On that first visit we started the evening off with three different sampler
trays (one per person with 6 different beers). You can either go with
pre-selected sets or pick your own. In the latter case you fill out a piece of
paper with 6 numbered placeholders. As the trays themselves have numbers right
next to each beer holder, you can easily find out again, which ones you
got. Nice idea!

As you can see from the picture above, they also have a nice variety of tastes:
From wheat to IPA, from Lager to Saison. So far, everything I've tried there was
really tasty!

Their food isn't to be ignored, either. They have a nice selection of burgers
and other meals but perhaps the most surprising entry in the pub's menu was the
"Spicy Fried Chicken and Waffle". Yepp, chicken on a waffle with cheese. The
first taste was mostly a cultural shock but it ended up being extremely
tasty. Would probably eat again.

Oh, and one last thing: If you want to get fancy and get into Belgian-style
beer-pricing: Ulrich gave it a try during our second visit and looked far less
sober afterwards ðŸ˜‰

The Deschutes Portland Pub is definitely on my list of places I want to return
to if/when I come back to Portland again for the next set of events!
