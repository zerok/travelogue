Once you land at [Brussels International Airport][] you pretty much have two
ways to get to the heart of the city (using public transport, I mean): There is
a train connection - for which you can also get a ticket from within the baggage
claim hall - or by bus (lines 12 and 21, depending on what time of day yo
arrive).

Last year I took the train down to Gare Central. Nice, fast, but also
expensive. The ticket for one direction comes at around 8.40â‚¬ and once you're at
whatever train station you want to, you still have to buy another public
transport ticket if your hotel is not within walking distance.

That's why I took the bus this time around:
[At 4.50â‚¬](https://www.stib-mivb.be/ticket-airport-line.html?l=en) it only costs
about half of the train ticket and gives you connections during a 60 minute
time-window. As the bus takes about 30 minutes from the airport to Schuman (EU
district), there's enough time left to hop onto the next bus or metro to get to
the hotel. Only downside: You can't buy 48h or 72h passes at the vending
machines at the airport; something I noticed too late but will hopefully
remember for the next year ðŸ˜‰

Also, the day-pass is not a 24h one. It's valid on the day of first use up until
IIRC 2 am of the following day only. Bummer for my ticket-planning. At 7.50â‚¬ a
day-pass is slightly cheaper than a 24h ticket in [Vienna][], but a real 24h
ticket for Brussels would have been quite convenient... Otherwise the system
there is basically the same you will see in any other European city that has a
metro. Cheap mag-stripe cards and slightly more modern NFC or RFID-based ones
for the longer passes (although I also got one for my airport-ticket).

Most of the tram cars are very new and really nice! They even sometimes seem to
use a system that looks like a lightweight metro-system (with some slightly
awkward stairs). In general, I really enjoyed my time using public transports in
Brussels ðŸ˜ƒ
