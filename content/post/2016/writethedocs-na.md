One of the conferences I attended during the time in Portland was
[WriteTheDocs NA](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/), an event for
technical writers and does who like good documentation. The event took place in
the heart of the city in the
[McMenamins Crystal Ballroom](http://www.crystalballroompdx.com/) with tons of
opportunities to go sightseeing and shopping before and after each conference
day as well as during the breaks to get some fresh air.

Anyway, it was a great event with lots to write about ... which you can find
