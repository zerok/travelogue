Wow, I totally forgot to write about my very first CraftConf which I attended at
the end of April in Budapest ðŸ˜¦ Well, now the event has been over for 3 weeks now
I finally did that over [here][]. What's not covered there are (as always) the
restaurants and other places we visited during the trip. I'll try to get around
writing about them either during or after my trip to Portland for WriteTheDocs
and PyCon US.

To summarize: CraftConf was great. Perhaps a bit too big for my taste but still
well worth the visit. If you've never been there, give it a try!
