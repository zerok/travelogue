- What parallels are there between learning a new language (and French) and
  learning a framework.

## Five things we can steal from the language learning community

### Celebrate late adopters
- It's common to think that you have to be a child to easily learn a new
  language, but adults also have advantages.
- Adults can draw from existing knowledge which is something that is not
  possible to children.
- There are tons of ressources for adults if they want to learn a new
  language.
- In the technical community there is the perception that you have to
  learn coding when you're young and are looked down upon if you are
  late to the party.
- People who don't have a computer science background can bring
  something new to the community.

### Break down motivation barriers

- Django gives you early and much gratification.
- With a language it is a bit harder as the early steps you take seem rather
  useless.

### Facilitating Mentorship

- A mentor can answer questions that are not easily researchable
- Correction and feedback
- As a community we could benefit immensely from having a formal mentorship
  model.

### Immerse new learners

- Make it easy to experience the new environment.
- Documentation is often written in a way, that understanding has to come
  first. More code examples and more stories on how people actually use things
  helps here.
- "Implement first, understand later" as new mental model.

### Boost confidence

- Don't be shy because you could make a mistake. Be proud of what you've
  learnt.
- In the broader technical community we have the problem that people are
  afraid that they might look stupid if they ask a question.
- We need more people talking about their failures and what they've learnt from
  it.

## Discard old myths & Inspire participation

- [Keynote][jkm] by Jacob Kaplan-Moss at PyCon about this topic
- Engage, educate, appreciate contributions.

## Q&A

Deployment and timezone issues. How can the community help here?

- There are some core issues that might benefit from mentorship and more
  experience-report like documentation.

How can the contribution process be made more accessible?

- Introducing people to the community is perhaps something that should go
  through 3rd-party-apps first and then later on move to the core.
- Cookiecutters help here to get people up and running faster.

Are the solutions for getting an overview of the whole ecosystem and 3rd-party
packages?

- Mentorship might again help here. If someone has worked a package successfully
  or did have issues with it, that's better than having a simple website with
  checkmarks around features.
- It's hard for the community to endorse one package over another.
