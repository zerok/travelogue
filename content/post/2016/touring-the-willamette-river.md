A couple of days in town and after walked across the various bridges we noticed
some jet boats cruising on the river below. I had heard about a nice waterfall
nearby and so touring the river around Portland sounded like a nice afternoon
activity. We quickly picked
[Willamette Jetboat Excursions](http://www.willamettejet.com/) where they even
warned us that we would definitely get wet and possibly soaked. Fun ðŸ˜‰

The 2 hour scenic tour offered took us from the OMSI (Oregon Museum of Science
and Industry) up north past the NW Broadway Bridge and down south to the
Willamette Falls near Oregon City. We couldn't have picked a better day as we
had about 20ÂºC and not a single cloud in the sky. Our guide was fantastic, too,
telling us all sorts of stories about the various mansions lining the river
banks and diving deep into the history of the many bridges we passed
under. Turns out there are tons of swimming homes south of Portland which just
look beautiful. I'd definitely not say no if I got the chance to spent a couple
of nights there ðŸ˜‰

Our guide also apparently enjoyed his boat using every opportunity to drift and
splash around ðŸ˜‰ Before returning to the dock he asked if there was someone who
wasn't completely soaked by now. Turns out, pointing at someone will result in
that person getting some water from a hose ðŸ˜‰ In the end the trip was even more
enjoyable than we had anticipated. Great fun and definitely worth the 44 USD per
person!
