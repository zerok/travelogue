After the terror attacks in Paris last November, Brussels had been put on high
alert and soldiers began to support the civilian police in the Belgian
capital. Now, nearly 3 months later, there were still quite a few members of the
Land Component present in the center and the area around major EU
installations. That being said, during my whole stay I only saw 6 soldiers and
two or three light vehicles in total, just enough to make you aware that there
had been something going on and to make you feel safe but not enough to worry
you ðŸ˜Š

Having been a [Battlefield][] player before I immediately started researching
what rifles they were carrying ([FN FNC][], probably Model 7000), but that's
about it ðŸ˜‰ I was really just glad that enough time seemed to have passed that
the city wasn't in complete lock-down or panic mode and that the nearly
everything seems to have gone back to normal. Apart from the light military
presence the city had exactly the same feel from what I remember from last year
