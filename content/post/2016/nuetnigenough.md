Remember that restaurant we didn't go to on Friday evening? Well, Ulrich and I
went to the [Nuetnigenough](http://www.nuetnigenough.be/) on Sunday (two days
later) to try out more of the local cuisine. This one was even smaller than the
Fin de SiÃ¨cle but had the far more impressive menu. This was actually the first
place I've ever been to where beer is served in the same way as
high-price-restaurants treat wine. On a table next to us probably a local wanted
to introduce friends to this life-style and ordered multiple expensive "bottled
beers" (think ~20â‚¬ per 0.75l buttl) and within minutes wine-glasses began
stacking up next to use each filled with highly expensive beers!

Good thing that by that time we both had already had a marvelous main course,
dessert and two beers, otherwise we might have tried to emulate our neighbors ðŸ˜Š

Just for completeness' sake: I had a great Shepard's Pie (completely different
from what you'd get for instance in Wales as it also includes Spinach and is
much drier) and ice-cream based on Belgian fruit beer! Simply great!

It looks like our luck with picking good restaurants based on services like
Yelp, Foursquare, and TripAdvisor seems to continue!
