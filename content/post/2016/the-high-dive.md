After leaving the WriteTheDocs party Ulrich and I met up with Markus to explore
the restaurants and bars close to our appartment. The first stop here was
[The High Dive](http://www.thehighdivepdx.com/), a small beer and cocktail bar
with a nice menu and extremely friendly staff. While being right next to some
delicious food trucks you can also get some dishes here, like these great
nachios!

If the weather isn't nice enough to sit by the food trucks or you want to have a
bigger selection of drinks this is a really nice place to be at ðŸ˜Š

They even gave us the nachios for free after forgetting about our order (to be
fair, we had forgotten all about it too ðŸ˜‰)!
