## Notes

- Had issues with Math classes and excelled at programming courses which
  presents a problem when you actually want to finish with a CS degree.
- Other people had completely different experiences when it came to
  programming. Is programming more an art or a science then?
- In the early days, programming was seen more as an art (or even magic)
  while only hardware was considered a science or engineering.
- So what is art? The expression and/or application of human creative skills and
  imagination (among others).
- The interaction between art and its experience by the audience is cruicial.
- Art doesn't have to be real but it should be intense.
- Margaret Hamilton was the person who coined the term "software engineering".
- Software engineering is still a very young field, based on trial-and-error and
  in general differs greatly from other engineering fields.
- Programming languages are building blocks like Lego. You can go vanilla (basic
  blocks) or use frameworks (Lego city sets, ...)
- Programming is both: art and science. Art built on top of logic.
- Being a developer requires 4 important things that complement each other. You
  need all of them:
    - technical knowledge
    - curiosity
    - experience
    - creativiy
- How can we master our art?
    - Start with love and/or curiosity
    - Learn the tools of your future trade. In our case this means the basics of
      computer, getting started with a development environment and learning
      syntax and basics of the language you want to use.
    - Practice
    - Learn the concepts behind what you're doing and using. This doesn't only
      mean the language you're using but also things like design patterns,
      best-practices etc. These are often not specific to a single language but
      can be applied more generally.
    - Practice more to achieve a high level of technical skill.
    - Share what you've learnt. Sharing creates connections and relationships
      which helps you getting even better. This leads to the important topic of
      having and being part of a community.
- Community drives adoption. DjangoGirls is a great example here as it broadens
  the reach of the framework. There seems to not be anything comparable in the
  PHP community right now.
- PHP 7 was released last year and all improvements came from the
  community. There is a RFC-like process that guides these contributions.
- The Community also drives change and the creation of new patterns and best
  practices.
- The Community also drives progress. It can help you iterate on your personal
  goals (developer -> user groups -> conference attendee -> speaker).
- What is in it for me with sharing?
    - "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go with others."
    - Learning from others and getting feedback (or simply having fun)
    - Interacting with others increases your own confidence.
    - Being surrounded by people "better" than yourself is a huge motivator
- How can you help your community?
    - Create a local user-group if there isn't one already.
    - Share what you've learnt at your local group.
    - Provide translations
- Re-inventing the wheel can lead to better wheels. It's also a learning
  experience but keep your expectations in check ðŸ˜‰

### Q&A

How do you balance the conflict between getting more people out there to create
stuff while keeping the security and safety level high?

- Make sure that it's clear what is an experience and what's not.
- We have to built on the shoulders of others.
- New artists will have role-models that they will follow. Same thing probably
  also applies to developers.
- You can come up with a new idea but that doesn't mean that you will through
  everything away that came before you.

Programming has the perception that it is not a creative area. How can we get
around this?

- More contact between programmers and non-programmers.
- Programming is getting more approachable as a hobby which helps here. Think
  about things like Arduinos who are event accessible to children.
- Programming tries hard to be "serious" but should also except also people who
  want to do it as a hobby (for fun).
- Make it even more accessible ðŸ˜Š
