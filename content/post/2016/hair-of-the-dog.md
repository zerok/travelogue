One night while walking back from the city to our apartment we stumbled upon a
weirdly called brewery by the name of "Hair of the Dog". Looking it up a day
later we discovered that they had a rather diverse selection of beers as well as
some great sounding items on the food side of the menu. So after returning from
our trip to the Willamette Falls (more on that another time) and getting rather
sun-burned we decided to give it a shot.

Turns out they have the best Beef Short Ribs I've ever had. Sure, it's just a
slice of meat, but if you just touch it with a fork and it literally falls
apart, you know you've got something great ðŸ˜Š On top of that they add a great
potato-pasta-salad! They also had a very well made mix of a Tiramisu with beer
called a Beeramisu. Not exactly my taste but Ulrich and Markus enjoyed it very
much ðŸ˜‰

The beer was good, but not my favourite in Portland. Would I go there again?
Yes. The whole place is basically a refurnished factory hall, has great food and
good beer!
