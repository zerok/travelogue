title: Getting to Portland
---

Finally a journey without any significant delay ðŸ˜Š I left Graz at around 10:30
and arrived in Portland at dinner time of the same day without missing a flight
or losing anything and probably gaining weight due to two meals served during
the trans-Atlantic flight.

It looks like, though, it's becoming more and more complicated to get into the
USA by the year. Or the process at least changes every time I try. This time I
went from Graz via Frankfurt to Vancouver to go there through customers and the
border control to the US. The big difference from last year's experience in
Montreal was that I was directed to an automated terminal to enter all the data
I'd normally write onto the customs form on the plane. That terminal also took
fingerprints and a mostly black-on-black picture just as the customs officer in
their booth would previously have done. Once that step was completed, I went
into a waiting room expecting a go-ahead to the next station, which turned out
to be ... drum roll ... the customs officer in their booth ðŸ˜‰

Anyway, after getting through customs I could board the plane for the final leg
of the journey from Vancouver the Portland. Turns out, Air Canada also likes the
Dash 8 series. Sadly, that plane was in far worse shape than some of its cousins
operated by Austrian. After the landing some of us passengers had doubts that
the undercarriage was still completely intact ðŸ˜‰ At least the view was nice
(during the couple of minutes I managed to stay awake).

At PDX Markus and I met up and decided to wait for Ulrich to arrive two hours
later. Turns out there is a really nice restaurant there called [Beaches][]
which has a nice beer menu and great fries ðŸ˜Š
